               <h2>Background</h2>
               <p>I was born and raised here in St. Louis, more specifically born in Ferguson, and raised throughout
                  St. Louis throughout my childhood. In my childhood I only left here once, and that was to visit
                  Washington D.C. with my family.</p>

               <h2>After K-12 Education</h2>
               <p>I graduated high school a semester early in December 2017 and began to worked a few different jobs. I
                  was
                  a janitor, working for a maintence company inside Mastercard offices.
                  Then becoming a Sales Associate at Floor & Decor working there until I made a big decision on what to
                  do
                  next. After I left Floor and Decor, I decided to enlist into the Army
                  my contract finishing September of 2022.</p>
